Model description       : Sailor Moon for QUAKE II ver1.03


Other info              : THIS IS HOPFULLY THE LAST IMPROVEMENT
			  FOR NOW, I REDUCED THE SKIN SIZE TO
			  HOPFULLY FIX THE PROBLEM A LOT OF
	   		  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING.

			  Ther is a tremendous amount of 
			  verticies, more than what there
			  appears to be, I screwed up somehow.

			  NOTE: She shows a alot of panties
			  cause I'm staying true to the original
			  charicter. Plus it's just a body suit,
			  unless more skins come out. :)

			  sombody make some MORE skins!

Additional Credits to   : id Software, etc etc 

Thanks to               : evil bastard collins for makeing the fearie 
			  model that is truely the best fem figure
			  for quake so far!
